                <h1 class="Text-h1">Story Behind Tonkotsu ramen</h1>
                <p class="story-p">As you can see, Tonkotsu ramen (pork bone broth) is mainly seen in the southern area of Japan. It was first created by
                Tokio Miyamoto-san at his yatai (outdoor food stall) in Kurume, a city in Fukuoka prefecture, December 1937. He later
                went on to establish a brick and mortar shop called “Nankin Senryo”</p>
                <p class="story-p">The story of his discovery goes that one day when he went out shopping, leaving his mother in charge of the shop while
                he was gone, he returned to find that the soup was boiling and had become white in the process of overcooking. He
                believed that this broth would not be sellable, but in an effort to save it, he seasoned it and found that this version
                had super umami and was much tastier than his original recipe.</p>

                    <h1 class="Text-h1">How To Make</h1>
                    <h3>Tonkotsu Broth</h3>
                    <ol class="ul-make">
                        <li>Place pork and chicken bones in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Place on a burner over high heat and bring
                        to a boil. Remove from heat as soon as boil is reached.</li>
                        <li>While pot is heating, heat vegetable oil in a medium cast iron or non-stick skillet over high heat until lightly
                        smoking. Add onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook, tossing occasionally until deeply charred on most sides, about 15 minutes
                        total. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Once pot has come to a boil, dump water down the drain. Carefully wash all bones under cold running water, removing any
                        bits of dark marrow or coagulated blood. Bones should be uniform grey/white after you've scrubbed them. Use a chopstick
                        to help remove small bits of dark marrow from inside the trotters or near the chicken's spines.</li>
                        <li>Return bones to pot along with charred vegetables, leeks, scallion whites, mushrooms, and pork fatback. Top up with cold
                        water. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat, skimming off any scum that appears. (This should stop appearing within
                        the first 20 minutes or so.) Use a clean sponge or moist paper towels to wipe any black or gray scum off from around the
                        rim of the pot. Reduce heat to a bare simmer and place a heavy lid on top.</li>
                        <li>Once the lid is on, check the pot after 15 minutes. It should be at a slow rolling boil. If not, increase or decrease
                        heat slightly to adjust boiling speed. Boil broth until pork fatback is completely tender, about 4 hours. Carefully
                        remove pork fat with a slotted spatula. Transfer fatback to a sealed container and refrigerate until step 7. Return lid
                        to pot and continue cooking until broth is opaque with the texture of light cream, about 6 to 8 hours longer, topping up
                        as necessary to keep bones submerged at all times.</li>
                        <li>Once broth is ready, cook over high heat until reduced to around 3 quarts. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a
                        clean pot. Discard solids. For an even cleaner soup, strain again through a fine-mesh strainer lined with several layers
                        of cheesecloth. Skim liquid fat from top with a ladle and discard.</li>
                        <li>Finely chop cooked pork fatback and whisk into finished broth. To serve, season broth with condiments of your choice
                        (salt, soy sauce, miso, sesame paste, grated fresh garlic, chili oil or a mixture of all, for instance) and serve with
                        cooked ramen noodles and toppings as desired.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Chasu Pork</h3>
                    <ol class="ul-make">
                        <li>Combine the soy, sake, mirin, sugar, garlic and green onions in a ziploc bag large enough to hold the pork belly. Stick
                        a straw in the bag and seal the ziploc bag up against it (so the straw is the only opening). Suck as much of the air out
                        as you can and seal.</li>
                        <li>Sous vide the pork for 10-11 hours at 170F.</li>
                        <li>Remove pork from the ziploc bag. Discard the bag and marinade.</li>
                        <li>Let the chashu pork belly cool completely. and then slice it into 8 or 12 slices</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Soy Bacon Tare</h3>
                    <ol class="ul-make">
                        <li>Combine all the ingredients in a small sauce pan. Simmer at the lowest setting for about an hour. Top up with a bit of
                        chicken stock if needed.</li>
                        <li>Remove the bacon.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Miso Tare</h3>
                        <ol class="ul-make">
                        <li>Combine all ingredients in a small sauce pan and simmer at the lowest setting for about 5 minutes.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Assemble the ramen</h3>
                        <ol class="ul-make">
                            <li>First Boil the noodle (u can use instant noodle from the store) until it soft.</li>
                            <li>now add 3 table spoon soy bacon and miso tare to the bowl.</li>
                            <li>and then add the noodle and broth to the bowl. </li>
