                <h1 class="Text-h1">Story Behind  Dorayaki</h1>
                <p class="story-p"><p>Dorayaki is a traditional Japanese sweet that consists of two small pancake-like patties made from castella batter (a type of sponge cake) filled with sweet red bean paste known as "anko" in Japanese. This delicious snack has an interesting history that dates back to the 16th century.
                    According to legend, a famous samurai named Benkei was traveling across Japan when he met a poor farmer named Usui Tarō. Benkei was tired and hungry, so Usui Tarō offered him a meal of two small pancakes filled with sweet adzuki bean paste. The samurai was delighted with the tasty snack and asked Usui Tarō what it was called. The farmer replied, "dorayaki" because the pancakes resembled the shape of a traditional Japanese drum called a "dora."
                    The popularity of dorayaki spread rapidly, and it became a popular snack in Japan. In the 1900s, a confectionery company named Usagiya started selling dorayaki with the modern red bean paste filling we know today. The company's founder, Seigoro Murata, is credited with inventing the modern version of dorayaki.
                    Dorayaki gained even more popularity when it was featured in a popular Japanese children's cartoon series called "Doraemon." The cartoon character Doraemon, who is a robotic cat from the future, is known for his love of dorayaki and often uses them as a reward for his human friend, Nobita.
                    Today, dorayaki remains a beloved snack in Japan and is enjoyed by people of all ages. While the traditional red bean filling is still the most popular, there are now many different fillings available, including chocolate, custard, and even matcha </p>

                        <li>In another bowl, sift flour and baking powder together. </li>
                        <li>Gradually add the flour mixture to the egg mixture, while mixing it with a whisk. Add water and mix well until the batter is smooth. </li>
                        <li>Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and let the batter rest for 15 minutes. </li>
                        <li>Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and lightly coat the pan with vegetable oil using a paper towel. </li>
                        <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until bubbles form on the surface of the batter. </li>
                        <li>Flip the pancake over and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes. </li>
                        <li>Transfer the cooked pancake to a plate and cover it with a damp cloth to keep it soft and moist. </li>

                        <li>Once all the pancakes are cooked, take two pancakes and spread a layer of sweet red bean paste on one side of the pancake. </li>
                        <li>Cover the sweet red bean paste with the other pancake to form a sandwich. </li>
                        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining pancakes and sweet red bean paste. </li>
                        <li>Serve the dorayaki immediately or store them in an airtight container for later. </li>
